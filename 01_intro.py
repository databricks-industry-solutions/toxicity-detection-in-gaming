# MAGIC ## Overview
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Toxicity can have a large impact on player engagement and satisfaction. Game companies are working on ways to address forms of toxicity in their platforms. One of the most common interactions with toxicity is in chat boxes or in-game messaging systems. As companies are becoming more data driven, the opportunity to detect toxicity using the data at hand is present, but technically challenging. This solution accelerator is a head start on deploying a ML-enhanced data pipeline to address toxic messages in real time.

# MAGIC ## About This Series of Notebooks
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * This series of notebooks is intended to help you use multi-label classification to detect and analyze toxicity in your data.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * In support of this goal, we will:
# MAGIC  * Load toxic-comment training data from Jigsaw and game data from Dota 2.
# MAGIC  * Create one pipeline for streaming and batch to detect toxicity in near real-time and/or on an ad-hoc basis. This pipeline can then be used for managing tables for reporting, ad hoc queries, and/or decision support.
# MAGIC  * Label text chat data using Multi-Label Classification.
# MAGIC  * Create a dashboard for monitoring the impact of toxicity.

# MAGIC #### Jigsaw Dataset
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * The dataset used in this accelerator is from [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.google.com/). Jigsaw is a unit within Google that does work to create a safer internet. Some of the areas that Jigsaw focuses on include: disinformation, censorship, and toxicity.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * Jigsaw posted this dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data) three years ago for the toxic comment classification challenge. This is a multilabel classification problem that includes the following labels:
# MAGIC   * Toxic, Severe Toxic, Obscene, Threat, Insult, and Identity Hate
# MAGIC

# MAGIC ##### 2.1: Download jigsaw dataset
# MAGIC The Conversation AI team, a research initiative founded by Jigsaw and Google (both a part of Alphabet) are working on tools to help improve online conversation. One area of focus is the study of negative online behaviors, like toxic comments (i.e. comments that are rude, disrespectful, or otherwise likely to make someone leave a discussion).
